Our Prime Minster ,**Narendra Modi** started the Swach Bharat Abhiyan on October 2,2014 the birth anniversary of **The Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.**
The mission aims to make the countries streets, buildings, etc. clean. The project has received active participation by government offices,
schools, colleges and other such organization like NGO's in the initial phases.

One of the main reasons for starting the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan was to *increase the number of laterines* in the country because atleast more
than 40% of our population did not have proper facilities for defecation. The starting of this mission actually helped in creating awareness among
people about the current situation and also helped in increasing the number of laterines in the country so as to help people who did not have access to one.

This mission was supposed to have gotten results by 2019,but unable to change the condition by much.
