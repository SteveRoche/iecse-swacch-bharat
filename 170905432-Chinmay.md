# Swachh Bharat - A necessity

>### ***Cleanliness is a state of purity, clarity, and precision.***

Open defecation and sewage contamination of drinking and bathing water has been an endemic sanitary problem in India. In 2014, India was the country with the highest number of people practicing open defecation, around 530 million people.

**Swachh Bharat Abhiyan** is started to make India a clean India by the effort of all the citizens living in the country.
It has been clearly declared by the Prime Minister, *Narendra Modi*.
One of its main objectives is to bring about an *improvement* in the general quality of life in the rural areas, by 

- promoting cleanliness, 
- improving standards of hygiene, and 
- eliminating open defecation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to each citizen of the country to take a pledge as a part of the ‘Swach Bharat Abhiyan,’ which is as follows,

>*“I will remain committed towards cleanliness and devote time for this. I will devote 100 hours per year, which is two 
hours per week, to voluntarily work for cleanliness. I will neither litter not let others litter. I will initiate the quest for 
cleanliness with myself, my family, my locality, my village and my work place”.*

Cleanliness drive is the best start of eliminating social issues from the society as well as promoting the growth of country with its 
citizen’s individual growth. Only the success of cleanliness campaign may bring a huge positive change in the India. It belongs to the 
internal and external growth and development of everyone living in India which shows us the completeness of slogan of “Clean, Happy and 
Healthy Citizens imparts Healthy and Developed Nation”.

Many __Educational Institutions__ have enforced Swachh Bharat Initiative, and encourage students to not only eliminate waste, but to also 
reduce waste production and spread awareness about the same.
