Hallo, frands, keep your country clean.
Clean up after yourself :

- Beep your own bad words (~fuck~)

- Stop yourself before every bad joke :speak_no_evil:

- Pick your hideous self worth off the streets :cherry_blossom:

- Chuck any negative thoughts into the nearest waste basket where it belongs :tada: 

Okay, I can't think of any more. :disappointed:

Bye! :wave:
