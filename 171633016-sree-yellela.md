# swachh bharat
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or Swachh Bharat Mission is a nation-wide campaign in India for the period 2014 to 2019 that 
aims to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of India's cities, towns, and rural areas. 

A similar project like this is digital india 
Digital India is a campaign launched by the Government of India to ensure the Government's services are made available to citizens 
electronically by improved online infrastructure and by increasing Internet connectivity or
by making the country digitally empowered in the field of technology.

**Now we can blend these projects for the development of swachh bharat**

We know hygiene,cleanliness and sanitation are a basic amenity like food,water and shelter
Many rural area people do not have this amenity .
But thats not the case with internet , at least after jio is launched :stuck_out_tounge_winking_eye:
we can solve these problems by developing software which should be able to get the job done.
for example
1. Software apps by which people can report problems to the government without actually having to wait in lines.
etc
