**Now we can blend these projects for the development of swachh bharat**

We know hygiene,cleanliness and sanitation are a basic amenity like food,water and shelter
Many rural area people do not have this amenity .
But thats not the case with internet , at least NOT after jio is launched :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
we can solve these problems by developing software which should be able to get the job done.
for example
1. Software apps by which people can report problems to the government without actually having to wait in lines.
2. Increase our reliance on solar power.
3. Invest more in recycling supply chains and infrastructure.
4. There’s a type of concrete that can ‘eat’ air pollution. This type of concrete could be used in government-funded infrastructure projects. And also, there could be a mandate for private builders as well.
Mobile Apps to Report Dirty Areas - And the civic body responsible must take action on it. It should be a govt-citizen responsibility. **‘Swachhta’** app by central govt is a good example.
There’s a type of road building material that can help in reducing NOx emissions.
Adopt these solid waste management technologies
