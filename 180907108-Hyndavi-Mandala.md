## SWACHH BHARAT ABHIYAAN
# Started in 2014 a national wide clean up mission which aims a clean India by 2nd october 2019.
# The motto of this initiative is "EK KADAM SWACHHTHA KI OR"
# This was started by the prime minister Shri Narendra Modi in tribute to the Father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi.On october 2,2014 the campaign flagged off at INDIA GATE. 
# He started a pledge of having a clean nation , which had an active participation of around fifty lakhs of government employees all over the country.Followed by the oath the prime minister himself picked a broom up and started sweeping the roads of the MANDIR MARG police station.
# This campaign mainly focuses not only on keeping our own houses clean but also thge whole society and environment clean.It mainly focuses on issues like littering,spitting and mostly open defacation.
# There are many health issues that would arise due to lack of toilets in every house.This is the most ignored problem in our country.To get this into people the prime minister appointed few ambassadors who were bollywood actors,sportspersons,singers etc. they also started campaigning about the need of cleanliness
# We now have to complete about 100 contact hours on cleanliness for swachh bharat internship as per new rules of AICTE.Many clubs in MIT are trying and giving these hours by conducting various workshops,and this one mainly by IECSE is really awesome.

# Concluding by a quote of **George Adams**
 > The cleanliness is essential to conducting nano-scale research
