On 15 August 2014, the people of India listened as their newly elected Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, delivered his maiden Independence Day address from the Red Fort. This was a historic moment: the first time a Prime Minister of India had addressed the nation on the subject of toilets. "Why", he asked, "was the shameful practice of open defecation rampant in the India of the 21st century?” In his speech, he set the audacious goal of fulfilling M.K. Gandhi’s vision of a clean India by 2 October 2019, Gandhi’s 150th birthday. It was a moment of disruption.
Political disruption succeeds when translated into implementational disruption.The Swachh Bharat team realised that if it was to achieve the seemingly impossible goal of an open defecation free (ODF) India it had to become a disruptor; it had to change something in the behaviour settings of fellow government officials throughout India. Widely successful in its primary goal of eradicating open defecation, the programme has now broadened its target to building a cleaner, better country, in mind and body.
