In support of this movement, the government is planning to draft new laws that will allow municipalities to punish those who are caught spitting or throwing garbage in public.

Various activities and aims that come under this campaign are:

1. Cleaning roads by
   * Sweeping
   * Picking up trash
   * Raising awareness about cleanliness and it's importance and about each individual's role in achieving cleanliness.
2. Solving the problem of open defecation and the diseases that spread with it by making toilets more easily available to the population.
3. Solid waste management.  
4. Stop the contamination of rivers.

The advantages of this campaign are:

1. Boost in tourism
   * Cleaner surroundings will promote tourism
2. Improve the health of the population
   * Increase in cleanliness will improve the health of the people, effectively increasing happiness and productivity.
3. To start using clean technology
   * Start using new technology that causes less pollution which will in turn increase cleanliness 

The difficulties faced during the execution of this campaign are:

1. Need of support from the community
   * A small group of people cannot solve nationwide problems. Participation from a huge group is required to bring about a change.
2. Sustained effort
   * It is highly likely that a person's enthusiasm will wane quickly, while this movement will require continuous efforts.
3. Difficulty in enforcement
   * It is difficut to increase participation or to reduce littering with an innate sense of responsibility within the people.
   
It is extremely necessary to make sure that this movement is a success. A collaborated and continuous effort, possibly spanning generations, is required to achieve this goal. Each of us, the citizens of India need to realise our responsibility and role in making our surroundings cleaner and more beautiful.
