# Introduction

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) on **October 2, 2014**, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The ambitious programme aims to make the streets, roads and infrastructure across the country clean by October 02, 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation. It is Indiaâ€™s biggest ever cleanliness drive.

## The relevance of the Swachh Bharat Mission

Sanitation has emerged as a key issue since the 2011 Census highlighted e glaring data on lack of toilets in the country by stating that over 26 million people in India defecate in the open. Launched with an estimated cost of around Rs 62,009 crore, Swachh Bharat Mission aims to achieve the elimination of open defecation in the country. Among its other objectives are conversion of insanitary toilets to pour flush toilets, putting an end to the inhuman practice of manual scavenging and carrying out Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM).

## How far we have come

Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala are the three states that have been   declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) this year. As per government data, as of December 16, over 58% of Indian households have become open defecation free. According to the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Punjab will achieve the ODF status by March 31, 2017.
