## Swatchh Bharat Movement

India is a global leader and one of the most developing countries in the world. But there are still som problems that stand in the way of
our progress. lack of safe drinking water, sanitation, public toilets and pollution are roadblocks and very serious issues that need to be 
solved from the root up. Under **Swatchh Bharat Abhiyan** , we along with the government must work towards improving our quality of life , 
enhance gender inclusion and keep our country *Clean and Green*.

As Gandhiji said " Be the change you wish to see in the world ". we must not only wait and hope that the movement will take effect on its 
own.It is the responsibility of each one of us to keep our country clean and help it benefit. Having said that, we as engineers in the
making must contribute in this movement and find sustainable and cost effective solutions that help us to add value and create a better
India. we must holistically and ecologically think and act and ensure that our efforts propel India forwards. Friends, lets make India, our 
country, free from sanitation , and cleanliness issues.
**Swatchh Bharat Sundar Bhrat**
