##### Swachh Bharat is an campaign by the Government of India to:

* To make India **clean** through *behavioural change*.
* To promote idea of **Smart City**. *A city needs to be clean before it becomes smart.*
* To eliminate the burden of communicable disease which India has like **Malaria, Diarrhea, Cholera.**
* To fulfill **SDG Goal 6 of UN**: Ensure availability and sustainable management of *water and sanitation for all.*
* To emphasize on the fact that clean mind and body reside in clean environment.
* To effectively and efficiently **handle waste generated.** People are encouraged to *separate wet and dry garbage for this.*

##### These goals are intended to be met by 2019 in time for Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth aniversary.
