# Shantam Maheshwari

**The Swachh Bharat Mission**'s effect is clearly noticeable in my school. As much as I hate to admit it, my fellow Delhite students used to litter everywhere, be it throwing wrappers out of the school bus' windows or wasting food from the canteen that we didn't like. This movement has brought about a change in our mentality, myself included, and now we all discourage littering, if ever seen in our sight.

:smile:

Now that I am in college, all the messes keep a daily track of the amount of food wasted in each meal and they display it on a whiteboard kept in front of the plate displosal area as a *nudge*, reminding us not to waste our food. The streets are visibly cleaner as well. In fact, my college is ranked 3rd in the list of the cleanest campuses in the country. All thanks to Swachh Bharat Movement!
