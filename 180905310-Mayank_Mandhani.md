__Swachh Bharat Abhiyan__

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a mission launched in India from 2014-2019 with the aim of making the country cleaner
by cleaning up roads, streets, gardens etc in all towns, cities and rural areas. It was launched by Honourable Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi 
on 2nd October, 2014 on the eve of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti at Rajghat, New Delhi to honour the late Father of the Nation at his  burial site.
The mission also aims at eradicating open defecation which is a major proble in Rural India by construction of TOilets and Urinals both domestic
and public and ensuring proper use pf them. The mission will also contribute to India reaching Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), established by the UN in 2015.
It is the nation's largest ever cleanliness drive.

The government has constructed 86 million toilets since 2014, reducing the number of persons who openly defecate from 550 million to fewer than 1 million in 2018 and 
it aims to achieve an "open-defecation free" (ODF) India by 2 October 2019, the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, by constructing
90 million toilets in rural India at a projected cost of â‚¹1.96 lakh crore.

Narendra Modi has been very influentil with this cause as he rightly called it:
