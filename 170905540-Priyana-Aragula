India as a nation has significantly improved in the areas of environment damage control as well as spreading awareness of the same. The Swachh Bharath Mission is a nation-wide campaign, aimed at amelioratng the infrastructure of India by cleaning streets, towns, and cities of the nation. Launched on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the campaign currently has over three million government employees and students from all parts of India participating in it. Problems like open defecation and sewage contamination of drinking and bathing water have been an endemic sanitary problem in India. The mission was launched to solve these issues and work on the foundation of finding salubrious origins for the country.
So long as you do not take the broom and the bucket in your hands, you-cannot make your towns and cities clean. - Mahatma Gandi
