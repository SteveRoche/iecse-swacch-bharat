### E Waste and Swachh Bharat

Plastics, chemical effluents and other mainstream pollutants grab the headlines, but a significant yet neglected type of waste/pollutant 
isnt talked about as much - 
**E-Waste**

_Discarded batteries, mobile phones, electronic devices_ etc make up **millions of tonnes** of waste and are one of the most harmful pollutants
given that their components are made of toxic compounds which when exposed to the nature can bring about some rather horrifying effects.

#### Ways to combat e-waste

_We've all heard of the 3 Rs_

1. Recycling components

Most of us dont bother to find the right place to recycle our e-waste and just discard it to our convenience. Hence we need major efforts from 
the govt or private companies to make e-waste recycling convenient enough that people would adopt it on a large scale.
_Take-back programs_ are slowly expanding, and many companies allow customers to return at least some computer models and equipment when they no longer want them. Apple, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Sony and Toshiba are some of the companies that take back some of your old electronic devices.

[E Parisaara](http://ewasteindia.com/) , India's first authorized e waste recycler, aims to take this initiative forward.
It could go on to become a major front for the _Swacch Bharat Campaign_

2. Reusing aged components

While the wider public may not have knowledge of how to integrate certain parts of aging devices into new ones, they could donate those 
devices to certain companies that gather reusable components and use them in new devices.

[Surplus Service](https://surplusservice.com/) is a  e-waste management business that specializes in medical recycling, electronic liquidation, reverse logistics and data eradication.

3.Reduce

While its not possible to reduce our production and usage of electronic devices in an increasingly tech savvy world, what we can reduce is 
our wastage of electronic devices. Careful usage and regular maintenance can help to increase the lifespan of a device. Use your gadgets 
for as long as you can, until a point where you absolutely have to replace them.

> The success of the Swacch Bharat Campaign relies overwhelmingly on our little individual contributions and it is no different in the case of e waste. **So let's all do our bit**
