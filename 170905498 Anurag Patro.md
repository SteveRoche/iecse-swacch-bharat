## This is my take on Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan as part of the IECSE Open Source Workshop to learn Git using Markdown.

### Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan is a very significant campaign launched by the present BJP-led government, under the aegis of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi as a preventive measure to improve and ensure cleanliness in all stratas and areas of the country unconditionally. 
### This particularly requires people to contribute in cleaning their surroundings in a plethora of events arranged by the different private and municipal organisations apart from self-implementing such practices.
### Another campaign in effect is the requirement for undergraduate students of all streams to contribute 100 hours during the tenure of their undergraduate course towards cleaning their surroundings.
### To facilitate the same, as we at Manipal saw the importance of technology in Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, the technical club IECSE took the initiative of conducting a workshop on Github (learnt using the language Markdown) to distribute knowledge regarding version control services (VCS) which essentially makes data storage much cleaner and simpler to handle. 
* This stands as an analogy to the Swachh Bharat campaign where we are trying to make the world a cleaner and safer place for ourselves as well as others who share this environment with us.
