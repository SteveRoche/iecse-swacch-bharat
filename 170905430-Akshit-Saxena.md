The __Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan__ is believed to be the biggest ever cleanliness drive in India. Founded by our Prime Minister
Shri Narendra Modi. It was inaugurated on the 145th birth anniversary of the Mahatma Gandhi. 

### The Target of this _Abhiyaan_ is to :
- Strengthen the sanitation system in rural and urban areas. :pray:
- Motivate and spread cleanliness awareness among people. :poop:
- Create user friendly environment for all enterprises interested in investing in
India for maintenance of cleanliness. :angel:
(_and many more..._)

Many influential personalities have been actively involved with this drive. The Prime Minister initaly had nominated nine people,
who joined the campaign and in turn nominated nine more people. By this date, the likes of _Amitabh Bachchan_, _Kailash Kher_, 
_Priyanka Chopra_, _Aamir Khan_, _Sachin Tendulkar_, etc. have been associated with Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan.
