# SWATCHH BHARAT ABHIYAN

# The Swatch bharat abhiyan is a 2 way programme which includes awareness and implimentation of the cleanliness around us.
# It is one most famous programme putup by the Govt. of India.


# According to the report's this govt. iniciative is growing very rapidly :boom: 
# But there are some place's in india where this movement is taken as a political party movement, and people are reluctant to support this scheme.
# I think if there is no unity to this programme or only certain people appreciate & help this programme nothing is going to be achieved.
# It depend's on the people and there understanding. Since the ruling party has some agend's which hurt some people and hence they are inactive to this programme.
# For this programme to be successful ,it is required that people change their mind set and at the same time the ruling party also change its fey agenda's.
 
 
 
 
 # IF THE ABOVE CRITERIA'S ARE FULLFILLED THIS PROGRAMME IS THE BEST EXAMPLE FOR:BOOM::BOOM: "UNITY IS STRENGTH":BOOM::BOOM:.
