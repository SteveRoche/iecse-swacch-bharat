## Swacch Bharat Mission
### The main focus of this initiative is to achieve universal sanitation coverage, educating people about it and coming up with innovative solutions as well.
As of now there have been great developments,
* 8,77,56,699 HouseHold toilets built since 2nd Oct,2014
* 5,17,037 Open Defecation free villages
* 4,465 Open Defecation free villages in Namami Gange
* 530 Open Defecation free districts
* 25 Open Defecation free States/UTs \
The list goes on.\
The upwards trajectory of this mission ( http://sbm.gov.in/sbmdashboard/IHHL.aspx ) really reflect the fact that the government has really put their best foot forward to help the cause.\
The prime vision of the government is to give a fitting tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary in 2019.
Individually, I try to implement the Swachh Bharat mission on a personal level by keeping my house, my hostel room clean, my surroundings clean. This is the least we can do as even the smallest changes in our attitude towards cleanliness can have a huge impact.\
I would really encourage people to check out the developments of this initiative and get inspirted to do the same http://swachhbharatmission.gov.in/sbmcms/index.htm \
And also scratch the innovate part of our brain and come up with more ways to contribute.\
