The Swacch Bharat abhiyaan, started with the goal of making India cleaner and greener, mght seem a bit far fetched at first.
The sight of roadside trash is so deeply rooted in the minds of every Indian that even the thought of a pristine clean, sparkly Indian city is revolting.

That's why it took a visionary as bold and determined as PM Modi to conceive it and kick it off- and what a blockbuster kick off it was. Bollywood superstars such as Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bacchan, sportspersons including Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli , politicians - anyone who was anyone participated.

The mission aims to make india open-defecation free through the construction of 9 crore toilets in rural areas by October 2nd, 2019. The Abhiyaan is expected to cost around â‚¹1.96 lakh crore (US$30 billion), and is India's largest, most ambitious cleanliness drive to date with three million government employees and students from all parts of India participating in 4,041 cities, towns, and rural areas. It's also unique in another aspect - the Swatchh Bharat Mission Mobile app, which is being used by the masses to monitor progress and achieve these high set goals. 

It's wildly ambitious and impossible, some might argue. But a cleaner India is well worth all these efforts, and I fully support the mission.
