The Swacch Bharat abhiyaan, started with the goal of making India cleaner and greener, mght seem a bit far fetched at first.
The sight of roadside trash is so deeply rooted in the minds of every Indian, that even the thought of a pristine clean, sparkly Indian city is revolting.

That's why it took a visionary as bold and determined as PM Modi to conceive it and kick it off- and what a blockbuster kick off it was. Bollywood supertars, sportspersons, politicians - anyone who was anyone participated.
