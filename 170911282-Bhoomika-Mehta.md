Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a Swachh Bharat mission led by the government of India to make India a clean India. 
This campaign was launched officially by the government of India on 145th birthday anniversary of the great person, Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd of October, 2014. It was launched at the Rajghat, New Delhi (cremation of Mahatma Gandhi).
The government of India has aimed to make India a clean India by 2nd of October 2019 (means 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma Gandhi) through this campaign.
It is a politics free campaign and inspired by the patriotism. It is launched as a responsibility of the each and every Indian citizen to make this country a Swachh country. This campaign has initiated people globally towards the cleanliness. Teachers and students of the school are joining this “Clean India Campaign” very actively with great fervour and joy. Under this campaign, another cleanliness initiative has been started by the UP CM, Yogi Adityanath in March 2017. He has banned chewing paan, gutka and other tobacco products in the government offices all over UP.

**Use of technology in Swachh Bharat:**

The tracking devises RFID can be installed for pick up and disposal of wastes in the trucks with electronic record of the truck route along with a time stamp and geospatial stamp. With this it is possible to calculate the number of participants in the programme, the number of plastic reusable bins available in the truck, non reusable bins available in the bins etc. It will be easy to plan how to dispose of the same effectively in advance.
Pay as you throw can be implemented by charging nominal fee of say Rs 5 per Kg. of garbage. The household will try to minimize the waste which certainly help the authrities. In middle class locality and higher end households do not mind paying this amount. It may also lead to throwing the garbage in nearby open localities unseen by any person. It will lead to health hazards.
Waste to electricity, ethonol or cooking gas are being tried successfully in many countries including in India. In Bangalore the BBMP has been using the wet waste to produce manure for use to plants. Also are segregating the wet and solid wastes at the level of each households. The solid wastes are sent for reuse. Wet waste is converted as manure. This requires further refining and planning, which will take place as the authorities gain experience.
The Bio - Toilets of Railways is another method of disposal of wet wastes.
Plastics and other reusable solid wastes are sent to reusable plants.
Potable Water is another immediate need of the vast majority of people who have not been covered under the scheme. Most of the cities and towns are covered under potable water scheme. The villages are the ones who are affected. This needs urgent attention
The sewage water is now let off into agricultural fields. These water produce toxic materials which are harmful to human consumption. Hence the sewage water should be scientifically treated before letting off into the fields. Technology provides for the reuse of these water. In Singapore it is effectively reused. In Delhi an attempt has been made for sewage water to be treated and reused.
