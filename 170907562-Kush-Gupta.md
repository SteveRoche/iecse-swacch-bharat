## A step forward - Swacch Bharat

India is a country of 1.3 billion people. Many people in our country live in quite poor conditions. They do not have access to basic things like 
proper meals, proper toilets , proper healthcare etc. In an effort to improve the quality of life , our prime minister __*Mr Narendra Modi*__ started
the **Swacch Bharat Abhiyan** to tackle the problem of open defecation.

The movement was launched in 2014. Its main objectives are listed below - 
- Construction of individual, cluster and community toilets.

- To eliminate or reduce open defecation. Open defecation is one of the main causes of deaths of thousands of children each year.

- Not only latrine construction, the Swachh Bharat Mission will also make an initiative of establishing an accountable mechanism of monitoring latrine use.

The youth of the country have a big role to play in this movement. Raising awareness is a key part. People shouldn't shy away from accepting the problems we as a country face.
Active participation of the youth in campaigns in places affected by the problem can prove vital. Politicians can visit their constituencies and participate with the public.
Over the course of just 4 years , the has had quite an impact.

1 . Jaipur and Ghaziabad are among the showpiece achievements of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The two cities have been honoured as the countryâ€™s 'fastest mover' among state capitals and big cities with population of more than 10L respectively following Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, after ranking 215 and 351 respectively among 434 cities in the previous year. 

2. Jaipur has also improved its garbage situation in the past two years. The municipal corporation has arranged for door to door garbage collection to reduce the number of open dumps.
And these are some of the many success stories of districts which have benefitted from the movement.

So let us come together to make India clean, healthy, habitable and above all a happy and safe country.
