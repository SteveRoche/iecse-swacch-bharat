The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which is also called as Clean India Mission is the most significant cleanliness campaign by the government of India. Shri Narendra Modi led a cleanliness pledge at India Gate
While leading  the mass movement for cleanliness, the Prime Minister exhorted people to fulfil  Mahatma Gandhi,s dream of a clean and hygenic India.


The aim of the mission is to cover all the rural and urban areas of the country to present this country as an ideal country before the world.
The mission has targeted aims like eliminating the open defecation, converting insanitary toilets into pour flush toilets, eradicating manual scavenging, complete disposal and reuse of solid and liquid wastes,
bringing behavioural changes to people and motivate health practices, spreading cleanliness awareness among people, strengthening the cleanliness systems in the urban and rural areas as well as creating user friendly environment for all private sectors interested for investing in India for cleanliness maintenance.


In my opinion Swachh Bharat is a great initiative by our government. It will turn out to be an effective movement if and only if we give propper support. This has become a Jan Andolan by far receiving tremendous support from the people.
There is Swachhata helpline number through which people can let government know which place is not clean.
