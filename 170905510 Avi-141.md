**Swachh Bharat-2018.**


It was a vision which has come to reality .
--------
Soon after Narendra Modi Ji was elected prime minister, he signaled that sanitation would be a priority of his social program. It was a reolutionary movement , a vision which had the larger picture in mind. In October, Mr. Modi introduced the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign, a raft of policies and public appeals aimed at creating a “Clean India” by the end of his term. 

Corporate support was commandeered to reduce open defecation, while the general public was charged with recycling and eradicating litter.Modi Ji urged a gathering of state ministers to help create “wealth out of waste.” 
After making his announcement Mr. Modi personally swept up some leaves and junk. He then nominated nine public figures to do the same, and asked each of them to nominate nine more — setting off a brief chain reaction of awareness and awkward broom-handling. He pledged to spend two hours every week cleaning up his surroundings, a commitment that was echoed down the halls of government and in schoolyards across the country.


As of today ,130 crore Indians have participated in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
With the hard work of each and every Indian, SBM, which completes four years today, has emerged as a vibrant mass movement with commendable outcomes.This break with tradition reflects an increasingly widespread belief that a clean India is everyone’s business, and that toilets make life better not only for women and girls but for all of us.The impact of the programme has shown on health and economic spheres as highlighted in studies by UNICEF and Gates Foundation. India has come  along way , and all of us have shown secularism , integrity and unparalleled determination towards the mission. 

Today, on October 27th ,2018 the students of Manipal Institute of technology have come together to contribute to this wonderful mission. We woulc be contributing  and creating to open source projects and would design a Platform ,which would aim to contribute and accelerate this movement and create an awareness about the importance of SBM.
