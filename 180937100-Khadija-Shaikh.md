Well, i'd consider Swach Bharat Abhiyan as one of the most effective schemes launched by the GOI and for the right reasons. Here's why:

Swacch Bharat Abhiyan launched by our PM on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi is India's largest ever cleanliness drive. And apart from the clean roads, walls, city, and proper waste disposal it also aims at reducing and eliminating open defecation through the construction of individual and community toilets and educate people to use them. Open defecation has been followed since very long time in India. People seemed adamant on their views regarding practising open defecation and denied the use of toilets even when government provided subsidies on the construction of toilets. The condition and perspective towards not using toilet can be accurately seen in Akshay Kumar's movie ‘Toilet- ek prem katha'.

According to me GOI has so far been pretty successful in changing people's perspective and educating them regarding very basic yet the most neglected area ‘sanitation’. Changing people's habits which they have been following since so long cannot take place overnight. Two major aspects targeted and achieved by GOI includes ‘behaviour change' and ‘hygiene promition’. Within a span of 3 years government has achieved pretty good results in that field.

Toilet coverage: 38%(2014) to 68%(2017)
2.5 lakh villages open defecation free.
204 districts declared themselves ODF.
Out of 550 million people only 300 million still practise open defecation. That means 250 million no longer practise OD. That is a population almost equivalent to Indonesia.
Although there's still a long way to go to achieve the target till 2019. But the positive steps taken in this direction by the government should be appreciated.

Apart from government initiative isn't it our duty to lend a hand in this movement. These days i can even see those garbage collecting vehicles in my city which have two different compartments for collecting dry and wet waste. And now isnt it our duty to at least separate the waste and hand it over to the workers accordingly. But i dont see most of the people doing that too. So i think not everything should be left on the shoulders of the government.

As Gandhiji has rightly said: It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of silver and gold.
