## Swachh Bharat Mission

### Its been more than three years since the mission of Clean India commenced with a vision to make India cleaner and more beautiful by 2019. Working on the mission, Prime Minister Narendra Modi motivated people to give a Clean India as a gift to Mahatma Gandhi.
### It is important that people from all stratas of society give their contribution in the mission. While the influencial and popular people could motivate others, the rest could do their own bit in the mission. It is necessary that the mission does not become another political stunt but is an organised with well planned steps. 
### Different things that cause the problem should be attended to systematically. Open defecation, open garbage dumping, littering in public places and other such sources of material pollution should be taken care of in a particular order instead of trying to solve all at once. While all should be kept in mind and minor steps should be taken, major plans should be implemented for the causes individually, in a sequence. 
### Technological advancement in the mission can give it the boost it requires. More information, more ideas, more inspiration and more participation will bring the change we want to see.
