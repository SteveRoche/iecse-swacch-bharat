## Swachh Bharat Mission

### Its been more than three years since the mission of Clean India commenced with a vision to make India cleaner and hence more beautiful by 2019. Announcing the commencement of the mission on 2nd October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi motivated the citizens to work for 'Swacch Bharat' in the loving memory of Mahatma Gandhi.
### It is important that people from all stratas of the society give their contribution in the mission. While the influencial and popular people could motivate the population, every individual can voluntarily do their bit by joining NGOs or movements working for the cause. It is necessary that the mission does not become another political stunt but is organised with well planned steps. 
### Different things that cause the problem should be attended to systematically. Open defecation, open garbage dumping, littering in public places and other such sources of material pollution should be taken care of in a particular order instead of trying to solve all at once. While all should be kept in mind and minor steps should be taken, major plans should be implemented for the causes individually, in a sequence. 
### The way the movement has ran till now, it seems to be in the right direction but still requires more efficiency. 
### Different proven methods of dumping wastes, segregating wastes, recyling and reusing, use of fabric bags should be encouraged to deal with the problem. Awareness campaigns can make the general public understand the seriousness of the problem, which is necessary.
### Government's programmes that fund different non-profitable organisations for working as a part of the mission, should regularly check that these funds are being used in an efficient manner and directives should be provided as and when needed.

## Technological advancement in the mission can give it the boost it requires. More information, more ideas, more inspiration and more participation will bring the change we want to see.
