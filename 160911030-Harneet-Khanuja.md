Swacch Bharat was initiative started by Narendra Modi in 2014 following his win in the Lok Sabha elections. It is a nation-wide campaign which aims to clean up the streets, rivers and the towns of India.The campaign received grreat reception from the common public. 
The government has proved its seriousness to the cause by involving various public figures to join their cause and spread their message to the general public. 
The cleaning of the river Ganges was a great start which led to more events like this eventually resulting in a cleaner India. The government also started the award for the cleanest city in which each city is evaluated on certain measures and the city which comes out to be the cleanest wins.
This award is held once every two years and Indore has been winning it from the past two times. This is a great incentive by the government to ensure that the local authorities do their part for the cleanliness of our country.
