The aim is to motivate the people of India through both words and actions. The PM himself carried out a drive in Varanasi.
The #MyCleanIndia movement was also launched simulataneously.Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has now become a ‘Jan Andolan’ in the sense that it has received complete support of the people. Citizens have turned out in large numbers and pledged for a neat and clean India. Taking the broom to sweep the streets, cleaning up the garbage, focussing on sanitation and maintaining a hygienic environment have become a practice after the launch of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. People have started to take part and are helping spread the message of ‘Cleanliness is next to Godliness.’
