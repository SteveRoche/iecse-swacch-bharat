On 2nd October 2014 our prime minister Mr.Narendra Modi took a great national initiative to make India a cleaner and more hygenic to live in.
The initiative is none other that **SWACCH BHARAT ABHIYAN** . This initiative aims to make India an *open-defecation free* country.
The goverment is trying to accomplish this by building **90 million toilets** in rural areas at a projected cost of 1.96 lakh crores.:anguished:

And since that day India has surely become a cleaner and a more hygenic place to live in. And one of the main reason for the success of the campaign are 
the citizen of India who actively took part in the aim that Narendra modi had set for the courntry and all of its citizen as a whole.
A lot of big names also helped in promoting the campaign. These big names include the likes of **Sachin Tendulkar**, **Priyanka Chopra**,
**Vidya Balan** and many more great personalites like these.
