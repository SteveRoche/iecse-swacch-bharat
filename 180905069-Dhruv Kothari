> godliness'
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is an ongoing campaign in India, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a nationwide cleanliness campaign. It 
has been implemented to fulfil the vision, and the mission of a ‘Clean India’ one day. It was launched on the birth anniversary of 
Mahatma Gandhi, who dreamed of making India clean and hygienic. He tried a lot, in his time, by motivating people through his campaigns
and slogans. However, because of the very negligible involvement of the people of India, he himself couldn’t accomplish his dream.
But, after years, Swachh Bharat Mission is gaining momentum to drive the dream of a cleaner India in the next five years, until the 150th
birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. It was started in 2014 on the 2nd of October. It is definitely a big challenge for all the citizens of
India and, it’s accomplishment is only possible if each and every person living in India understands the worth of this campaign, and their
own responsibility towards it, and try to collaborate together. It has been promoted by famous Indian personalities as an awareness
programme throughout India. In order to ensure cleanliness, Uttar Pradesh CM, Yogi Adityanath, banned chewing paan, gutka and other
tobacco products in all government offices throughout UP, in March 2017.
