# Swachch Bharat

Swachch bharat abhiyan was launched by the __Modi__ government as initiative to make India clean and sanitized.__Gandhi ji__ once said
"Cleanliness is more important than independence" which emphasized the importance of cleanliness.Swachch bharat abhiyan aims to achieve
three major objecives :
<ul>
  <li>Construcution of toilets for all.</li>
  <li>End manual scavenging of garbage</li>
  <li>Extensive campaign to create awareness amongst people to keep the country clean</li>
</ul>

As of now, 49.62 million more households in India have toilets–rising from 38.7% in 2014 to 69.04% in 2017–and 250,000 of India’s 649,481 
villages have been declared free of open defecation.As of 2016, 36.7% of rural households used “improved sanitation facilities”, according
to data from the National Family Health Survey 4, conducted between January 2015 and December 2016. As far as the urban areas are considered
around 11,000 community toilets and around 12,000 public toilets have been constructed.Around 44,000
wards have 100% door to door waste collection.

Technnology can have a great impact in achieving the Swachch bharat mission.. So on long term we need technology for garbage collection and conversion.
It is going to be a multi billion business and technology is the only saviour. Quick collection, fast transportation and seamless disposal through
segregation, conversion is essential. We need to invest in each of these and then only Swachch Bharat Abhyan reach a logical conclusion by 2019.
Few of the ideas that can be implemented are:
<ul>
  <li>Mobile apps to report dirty areas.</li>
  <li>Increasing reliance on solar power.</li>
  <li>Investing more in recycling supply chains.</li>
  <li>Adopting solid waste management technologies as per scientific definition.</li>
 </ul>
