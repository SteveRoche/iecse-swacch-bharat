Swachh Bharat! A mission, a dream! For the first time in the history of independent India, one leader initiated a mission of fulfiling the vision and the dream of our late Mahatma. Started in the year 2014, this mission undertaken by the Hounrable Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and his Government, this mission focuses on making India clean and green by the year 2019. It has two main aspects:
1. Swachh Bharat (*Rural*)
2. Swachh Bharat (*Urban*)
### What has it done so far?
India has seen a construction of 86 million toilets since 2014 and the number of people defecating openly has reduced from **550 million** to a fewer than **1 million** as of 2018. Celebrities handpicked by the Prime Minister himself, have been promoting this campaign to create more awareness amongst the general population. It also has provided employment to thousands of Indians and has shown amazing progress in the past years.
### How can we be a part of Swachh Bharat?
There are a lot of ways by which we can make Swacch Bharat a reality and a true success. We need not wait for someone else to start off with something big. Instead, we can take the first step and start small. Starting with our own homes, we can start off by cleaning our homes and surroundings. This can be achieved by disposing garbage properly, discouraging the use of plastic, plant trees and spreading awareness in our own societies via plays, presentations or small campaigns and thus following the principle of the **4R's i.e. RECYCLE, REDUCE, REUSE AND REPEAT**. We can also promote practises such as car pooling or regular check of disposal of waste by insdustries.
For more ways of promoting the campaign the Government of India has launched a website aswell as a mobile app for both **Urban** and **Gramin** parts. Given below are the links to the same.

### Conclusion
Swacch Bharat isn't just a campaign or a mission or mere words. It's a revolution. It's a pledge that each and every Indian should take! We don't need to rely on anyone to make our India clean. It was us who polluted our lands and it defintely has to be us who has to make India Cleaner, Greener and Better! 

*Jai Hind!!*
