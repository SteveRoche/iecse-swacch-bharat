Swachh Bharat! A mission, a dream! For the first time in the history of independent India, one leader initiated a mission of fulfiling the vision and the dream of our late Mahatma. Started in the year 2014, this mission undertaken by the Hounrable Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and his Government, this mission focuses on making India clean and green by the year 2019. It has two main aspects:
1. Swachh Bharat (*Rural*)
2. Swachh Bharat (*Urban*)
### What has it done so far?
India has seen a construction of 86 million toilets since 2014 and the number of people defecating openly has reduced from **550 million** to a fewer than **1 million** as of 2018. Celebrities handpicked by the Prime Minister himself, have been promoting this campaign to create more awareness amongst the general population. It also has provided employment to thousands of Indians and has shown amazing progress in the past years.
