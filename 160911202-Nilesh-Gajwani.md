**Swachh Bharat Abhiyan** or **Swachh Bharat Mission** is India's nation-wide campaign, from *2014 to 2019*. The cleaning of the streets,  roads and infrastructure of India's cities, towns, and rural areas is the aim of this mission. The name of the mission is in India's official language : **Hindi** and its English translation is **Clean India Mission**. The objectives of Swachh Bharat include: *  elimination of open defecation with the help of construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets
* establishing an  mechanism which is accountable for monitoring toilet use. 


The  mission is run by the **Government of India** and aims  to achieve an "open-defecation free" India by *2 October 2019*which is the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, by:
* by constructing 90 million toilets in rural India at a projected cost of â‚¹1.96 lakh crore (US$30 billion).
