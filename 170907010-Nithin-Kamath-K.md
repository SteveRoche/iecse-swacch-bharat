The Swachh Bharath Abhiyan is a nation wide campaign which was officially launched on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat,New Delhi by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This campaigns
aims to eradicate open defication by 2nd October 2019,which is the 150th annivesary of the birth if Mahatma Gandhi, by constructing aroound 90 million toilets.
Swacch Bharath Missiom isin Hindi and translates to 'Clean India Mission'.

This Mission by government towards cleanliness is a great initiative.On 15th September 2018 which was World Clean Up Day AISEC arranged a clean up drive were me and my 
friends participated in it. This drive was about cleaning the places near Manipal. So I think these drives were because of Swacch Bharath.
So i feel such a initiative by our government made a great change in our country and help our country to develop further.
