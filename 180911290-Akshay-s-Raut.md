## **Swatch Bharat**

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a nation-wide campaign in India for the period 2014 to 2019 that aims to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of India's cities, towns, and rural areas 

## How do we do that?

The swachh bharat abhiyan cant be acomplished by any single entity or as a matter of fact any single organisation or the  government alone.
It is only possible to clean our nation if everyone works together; or someone creates an economical teleportation device; but till then working together is our only shot.

### so on what do we work together?

anyone can contribute, 
1. to the least by just doing his duties as a good citizen to the nation *-which by the fact is very appreciable* because most of us do lack that.
to achieve this we need 
*a bit of patriotism, 
*a bit of hardwork, and  
*a bit of reponsibility
