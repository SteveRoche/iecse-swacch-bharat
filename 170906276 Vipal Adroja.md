# **_Swachh Bharat Abhiyan_**

As a responsible citizen of the country, this is my mini contribution to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan initiated by our honourable PM, Narendra Modi. Technological developments play in major role in driving the country towards cleanliness. GitHub is a community of developers to discover, share and build better software. It is a platform which which when used fruitly, helps in technogical advancements.

The drive has been categorized in two sub-missions:
1. Swatch Bharat Abhiyan (Urban) 
>operates under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
2. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Rural) 
>falls and operates under Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.

 Swachh Sarvekshan, an annual cleanliness survey commissioned by Ministry of Urban Development, is carried out by Quality Council of India to foster a sense of competition among different 
 cities of the country. Following are the five parameters on the basis of which the performance of each city is evaluated â€“
1.
* Open defecation
* Education, information, behaviour change and communication
* Municipal solid waste management, sweeping, collection and transportation.
* Provision of community and public toilet seats.
* Disposal of solid waste and processing.
* Capacity building and e-learning.
