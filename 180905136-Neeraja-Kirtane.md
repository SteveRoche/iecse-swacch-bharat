 Swatch Bharat is a very unique thing which is started by our president Narendra modi. The main aim of swatchh bharat abhiyan is to 
make India a very clean country. 
**The main aim is to build  toilets in India so that people dont defecate in public**
Many countries worldwide have recognised and appreciated this project.Even people like *Bill gates* has appreciated the efforts put in by India and our prime minister.
the feedback till now is that people think their villages and towns are cleaner now than they were before this initiative was started.
the goal of this mission is to make India clean till **2nd october 2019**.
**Mysore is the cleanest city in India**

This can only be accomplished if the people of India put in the efforts. Just by bragging about the mission nothing is going to happen.
We are the people who eventually going to bring out a change in the country.The youth of this country must put a step forward in making India cleaner 
than what it is now.The common and basic needs of man of having public bathrooms must be reached. It is us who should help the not so fortunate people of our nation and make this country better.
