- These are my thoughts on Swacch Bharat :boom:
* and how I think it's perceived.
\*based on what my limited knowledge\*.*

**What I think about it....**

Although I'm not an avid supporter of our PM's image and specific things about his policies, the Swaacch Bharat initiative really is something everyone should care about. Typically any drive for issues like these doesn't resonate with the larger reaches of our society. Even though we Indians talk big during class presentations,projects,reports,textbooks and in the media, we refuse to change our ways. The Swaach Bharat initiative really hasn't been given the importance it deserves partly because it has a political stigma associated with it and many people refuse to look past that - an issue with any public initiative in India in general. We've become to comfortable living our lives and choosing not to care about what we see around us and at the same time expect change to happen with everyone else. The day it isn;t percieved as a 'once a year' event to show that we care and becomes a daily duty that everyone on the ladder of society carries out with pride, is the day that the whole thing comes to fruition. It's only possible to clean up everything around us with direct cooperation from everybody involved. That means better waste management infrastructure , educating even the common man to segregate and properly dispose waste and integrate that mindset to everyone around us too. This has a long way to go but the speed at which people realise needs to pick up.

_That's it for now._
