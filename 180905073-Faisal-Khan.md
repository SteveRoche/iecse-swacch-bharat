*Swachh Bharat Abhiyan*, also known as the Clean India Drive, Clean India Mission or Swachh Bharat Campaign, is a campaign that has been 
launched by the Modi government in order to make India a thoroughly clean and sanitized country. Mahatma Gandhi famously stated 
“Sanitation is more important than Independence”, a comment that was meant to highlight the importance of cleanliness and sanitization 
of our country. Modi Government has come up with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to build a better nation by 2019.

**Why it is needed?**

Poor sanitation which has a significant impact.
Fecal-Oral Chain continues to contribute to

1. Morbidity (condition of being diseased)
2. Mortality (state of being subject to death)

The Modi government has urged the people of the nation to devote only 100 hours in a year to achieve the goal of cleanliness within their 
surrounding areas. Such efforts can really go a long way in making sure that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan becomes a grand success.
