## Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

Swachh bharat abhiyan is also known as Swachh bharat mission and it is a nation wide campaign in India which has a time stamp of 2014 to 2019. It has the slogan of "*One step towards cleanliness*". It was launched by our honourable prime minister *Shri Narendra Modi* on 2nd October, 2014 in New Delhi and it is since having an active participation from all over the country. It is India's biggest ever cleanliness drive. The urban component of this mission is being managed by the Union Ministry of Urban Development. Around **3 million** government employees and students participated in the event in its initial phase. The rural part of the mission is being handled by the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. Awareness is being spread in schools, colleges,etc to boost the participation and many other initiatives are taken by the government to promote and maintain it, such as the [Swachh bharat mission](https://swachhbharatmission.gov.in) website which showcases the achievements & milestones gained by the campaign, an interactive [SBM mobile app](http://msbm.gov.in/Public/Home.aspx) is also launched serving many features.
Some notable achievements in these 4 years are:
1. __5 Lakh+__ open defecation free villages
2. __529__ open defecation free districts
3. __25__ open defecation free states/UTs
4. __94.83%__ rural sanitation coverage & many more

It is a politics free campaign and inspired by patriotism. It is launched as a responsibility of each Indian citizen to make this country a Swachh country. Under this campaign, another cleanliness initiative has been started by the UP CM, *Shri Yogi Adityanath* in March 2017. He has **banned** chewing paan, gutka and such tobacco products in all the government offices across UP. This abhiyan will be concluded as a tribute on **Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birthday anniversary**. It is challenge only possible if each and every person living in India understands this campaign as their own responsibility and try to join hands together to make it a successful mission.
