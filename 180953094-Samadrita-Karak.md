As a part of the **SWACCH BHARAT** initiative, the government of India has implemented many projects. It was a dream project of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi and launched on Gandhi Jayanti,2014 to mark the 150th Birthday of the Father of the Nation, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.The projected date for completion is 2nd October,2019. As a part of the project, many parts of India have been declared open-defecation free due to the installation of public toilets for people who didnt have an access to toilets. :smile:

The project not only aims at providing toilets to everyone but also provide clean drinking water to all the people of India. Cleanliness, sanitation and hygiene are the main highlights of this project. About 50,71,725 individual toilets, 4,00,767 public and community toilets and 3,352 cities have been declared open defecation free.8 states and 2 union territories have been declared open-defecation free. Waste collection has been started instead of dumping waste in open spaces. Waste to Compost is also an initiative has been implemented in many cities.
