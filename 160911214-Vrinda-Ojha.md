The future of our country is in our hands and so is the responsibility of working towards it's betterment. The Swacch Bharat campaign was an initiative taken by Prime Minister **Narendra Modi**, but he shouldn't be alone in this. He has given us a platform and also incentives (which shouldn't have been necessary in the first place tbh) on making our contribution in this campaign.

> What can we do as students?
1. Try not to litter.
2. Pick up any trash which might be lying around.
3. Organize events involving cleaning up public spaces.

> What additional things should be done by the government?
Honestly, make it more fun! :clap: :clap: :clap: And try to involve a larger section of the society into this. Merging of the rural and urban groups of the society will lead to an intermingling amongst them. This can prove to be very beneficial for both the sectors and for the country.
