#Swacch Bharat 

##### The Prime Minister of our country has undertaken a huge task for improving the *hygiene* of the country.

**Important information about Swachh Bharat Mission**
- It was launched on 2nd October, 2014 with the help of Narendra Modi and the BJP.
- Received tremendous support from the people
- Government provides incentive of Rs.12,000 for each toilet constructed by a BPL(*Below poverty line*) family.
- The cleanest city in India as of 2016 is Indore.
- A robot named Swachh bot was creatted by a maker community in Chennai to clean wastes on Besant Nagar beach.

I think it is a brilliant iniative taken on by the government to help maintain cleanliness and improve overall living conditions especially in a developing country like India. 
In the four years that this mission has been running, India has seen great development in the hygiene and open defecation that happened.
