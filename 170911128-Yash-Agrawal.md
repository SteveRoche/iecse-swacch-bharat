The biggest challenge of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is discipline and culture . If indoctrination starts at home, gets nurtured at school , it gets its due momentum

On the above foundation , if Technology can speed up things , the promise is a great multiplier effect .

Discipline, Culture & Technology adoption/absorption can make a country reap the benefits in all walks of life and accelerate the development

## Maintaining cleanliness works at different levels

**Personal or Family level** - Educating , increasing awareness , making children inculcate good habits right from a young age

**Community level** - Again Education, Discipline , perception of common goodPublic Places - It is a joint effort with public civic sense/habits and administrators maintaining cleanliness

**Local governance level** - Efficient mechanisms for collection of garbage , maintenance of drains , disposal etc

Just like Family Planning concept crossed many socio-religious barriers and got increasingly accepted , Cleanliness has to become a way of life .In my opinion , making good citizens is the first pre-requisite for achieving cleanliness . This can be done very efficiently through technology . The education /awareness process can be through media say TV through innovative serials . We can have innovative rewards /incentives to make people adopt & adapt to cleanliness. There have to be penalties also for 10 % of people spoiling efforts of 90% peopleNext Technology can play a major role in launching low cost Toilets ,Bio Toilets , Garbage collection, disposal ,incineration plants, Bio -composting etc.The week link is Local governing bodies like Panchayats /Municipalities . Present governance structure , funding constraints make the job very difficult. It is not practical to bypass them . We have to find a new system by which NGOs /Trusts can be created with Government /Private funding who can take up the scheme on a missionary zeal . Technology is a great enabler in this process , but requires some body to foot the bill - direct government allocated.
