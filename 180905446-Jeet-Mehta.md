# **Swacch Bharat**

***Swachh Bharat*** is an indian nation-wide campaign to improve the hygiene and sanitation of the country and of it's citizens. It aims to clean the roads, streets and other public infrastructure in the country. It aims to achieve this goal by the year 2019. This campaign was launched by Narendra Modi on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2014. One of the primary targets of this campaign was to eradicate the open defecation problem in the country. Since its inception two union territories and eight states have been declared defecation free.

The mission has been greatly beneficial for the country. It has not only helped with the problem of open defecation, but also helped with other hygiene related problems like spread of diseases, and has helped with providing useful solutions like turning waste to energy and compost. A lot of prominent celebrities like Sachin Tendulkar and Shah Rukh Khan have shown their support for this campaign.
